It gives game developers the ability to add precisely timed, high performant sound effects and to create realistic spatialized sound landscapes. For many web developers it is the first time they encounter audio programming which leads to many interesting experiments when the world of web and audio collide. Traditional web developers start to become really interested into audio programming and educate themselves on the topic of synthesizers and audio effects. However, currently there are only few applications that try to create audio production or audio performance environments in the browser. In this talk I want to show how the Web Audio API can be used to create a collaborative music production environment similar to Garageband. Furthermore, I will do a live demonstration of a music performance setup which is inspired by The Glitch Mob\u2019s setup (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bXNo9MFXnU). Both demos will show how powerful the Web Audio API is and how important the web can become as platform for music production in the future.","id":"19058","isLivestream":false,"title":"Using the web for music production and for live performances","endTimestamp":"2014-11-22T10:45:00Z","url":"","startTimestamp":"2014-11-22T10:00:00Z","room":"ROOM72","tags":["TYPE_SESSION","THEME_1138"]},{"photoUrl":"http://devfest-berlin.de/images/speakers/jenskuehlers.jpg","color":"#3366cc","speakers":["19039"],"description":"In this session I will go over the history of containers at Google, what we have done internally, how containers differ from VM and what they are good for and what Kubernetes is.

Even if there's only scarce documentation for it, the Canvas API is at the heart of everything that shows a UI on Android. You'll need to tame this powerful and mysterious creature if you want to create great custom views and brilliant, lightweight UIs for your apps. What is a Canvas? How do you Paint? Can you draw Paths? What is Skia, and who invited it anyway? What actualy happens during a drawing pass? What are Shaders? What are Filters? Is it true that text is basically impossible to measure correctly? What shape does a Shape have if noone's painting it? These and other questions will get an answer during this session. Well, some of them will not, probably.
